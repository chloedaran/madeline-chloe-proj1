    We could see that the race that had the highest proportion of AP test takers on average was Asian.
    This was surprising because looking at the census data, the asian race was often not the higest proportion
    race in the state.

    A graph that could be useful in representing this data could be a stacked bar graph. 
    This graph can compare proportions of differnt races and ap statistics by state.
